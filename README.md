- 👋 Hi, I’m @taschana
- 👀 I’m interested in javascript related fullstack projects of all platforms, including all sorts of frameworks and compilers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Svelte and Electron.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... actually I am looking to learn. Basically about everything: how to improve project setups, using Electron or Svelte (obviously) but also how to imrpove my project-finishing skills ;)
